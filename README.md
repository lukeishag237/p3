# Assumptions
The assumptions outlined within the write-up hold.
Outside of them, it is assumed that, as this was the
primary method of testing, the user will be attempting
to run ./client and ./server in separate terminals,
though these can be in the same machine (like VSCode).
This is because server.c will run more or less
indefientely due to a while loop within it. This is
the primary assumption needed for running the code.
